In this folder, we save the developing materials for UMI_barcodes. 

See the README_umi_barcode.txt and ngs_umi_barcode -h for some information. 

In here we also save the testing examples and calling commands for run tests.

1)temp_125.fastq,   sequence input for doing tests.
2)temp22.txt, the calling commands and debugging output. testing non-identical gap penalty and mismatch. 
3)temp223.txt the calling commands and debugging info. testing identical value between gap penalty and mismatch.




Cases to test:
../ngs_umi_barcode -s temp_125.fastq -t -x -p NNNNNNNNNGGGAAA -f0 -g0 -e3 -n1 > test.out


../ngs_umi_barcode -s temp_125.fastq -t -x -p NNNNNNNNNGGGAAA -f0 -g0 -e4 -n1 > test2.out

../ngs_umi_barcode -s temp_125.fastq -t -x -p NNNNNNNNNGGGAAA -f0 -g4 -e5 -n1 > test3.out   #<- this is the case to see localAlignment_CT is better than regular/original localAlignment, but original one is faster. 
#we can also switch the pattern and subject. it works. don't remember what makes the changes.

../ngs_umi_barcode -s temp_125.fastq -t -x -p NNNNNNNNNGGGAAA -f0 -g6 -e5 -n1 > test4.out
