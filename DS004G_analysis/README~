In this folder, it contains the code to run the mapping of UPM and Constant region to the sequences.
Then, we trim the sequence to make it available for running for Matlab code of analyzing the generation probability.

There is no new code for this analysis, we basically use the previous code ngsmapping_adaptor from the LocalAlign project and call it probabily.

In the previous code we call this by running overlap alignment to map the 454 sequences. That is correct. since the sequence have to be started from both ends. 
but for this project, we are dealing with Illumina. it is a bit different. 
  1)no gapping???? (it seems this is not obsolutely true
  2)the mapping could be in the middle of the sequence, due to the cross over read.
  
  so calling local alignment in the code. instead of overlap alignment
  with much larger offset value and larger (? not very large)gap extension value.
