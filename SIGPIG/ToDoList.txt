1) DONE===>main.cpp, need to take care of unsigned, int for numOfSeq etc
2) DONE===>main.cpp, need to take care of delete allocated variables and arrays
3) DONE===>in alignment_object, add new field member maximum_deletion, need to check the code to make sure it is work!!!

4)DONE====>deserialize, need to check for the error flag, in case of reach the end of file buffer. or other errors
5)DONE===>delete allocated variables in alignment.cpp alignment_D.cpp deserialize

6) need to rewrite the deserialize function, we should have call to reset the data before read the data into it.

7) the j error position is relative to the end of the sequence (?). how should we take care of this??????????


8) please confirm with the code for this action, in the function doing the assignment of the model, whenever there is a
	return, we will either return a true or a false. when return a true, it is like in the original matlab code a "continue"
	command, we return from the function/loop and go next loop/next round of function. but whenever there is false return, we 
	we go upper to break the upper loop, and we might also need a flag to let it just out of the whole runs.
	to make sure I understand there is 3 different call
			continue
			break;
			return; 
	in matlab. 
	I need to be careful to distinguish in my c code all 3 levels . the stop at different scope

9) need take care of the cases where the number of errors are too more than the best one so far.
   *thought: need to use possion distribution

10) n_assignment_v_gene, n_assignment_j_gene, n_assignment_d_gene,
    how to update this and what to do with them?
