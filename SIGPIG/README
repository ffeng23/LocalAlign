This is the project to run statistical inference to estimate the generation event probability of the BCR/IGHV genes from sequencing data

The first step is to run alignments and prepare the alignment data for the next step, EM step. The reason we write the C++ code is that we want the code take care of "any" data without setting too much require for the input data. So, the plan is that we run local alignment for D region alignment as Matlab original does, and alignment with fixed 

Organization of files
--main.cpp, is for the general purpose testing.
--do_VDJ_alignments.cpp, is for running alignments
--do_probabilistic_model_fitting.cpp, is for model fitting


Arrangement of files
GenomicSegment.cpp hpp defines the abstract class of individual genomic
segment
	inherited by GenomicV, GenomicJ, GenomicD
GenomicSegments.hpp cpp defines 3 individual methods to read in the Genomic
gene segments. In addition, it defines necessary functions.


note: for ==>alignment object<<====,
      the J align position is relative to the begin /left side.
      but the J align error position is relative to the end/right side of the sequence
