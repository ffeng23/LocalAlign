For IGHV gene alleles
IGHV3-30-5 is missing sequence from IMGT
IGHV4-30-1 is missing sequence from IMGT
IGHV7-77 is missing sequence from IMGT
The FASTA header contains 15 fields separated by '|':

1. IMGT/LIGM-DB accession number(s)  
2. gene and allele name  
3. species  
4. functionality  
5. exon(s), region name(s), or extracted label(s)  
6. start and end positions in the IMGT/LIGM-DB accession number(s) 
7. number of nucleotides in the IMGT/LIGM-DB accession number(s) 
8. codon start, or 'NR' (not relevant) for non coding labels and out-of-frame pseudogenes 
9. +n: number of nucleotides (nt) added in 5' compared to the corresponding label extracted from IMGT/LIGM-DB 
10. +n or -n: number of nucleotides (nt) added or removed in 3' compared to the corresponding label extracted from IMGT/LIGM-DB 
11. +n, -n, and/or nS: number of added, deleted, and/or substituted nucleotides to correct sequencing errors, or 'not corrected' if non corrected sequencing errors 
12. number of amino acids (AA): this field indicates that the sequence is in amino acids 
13. number of characters in the sequence: nt (or AA)+IMGT gaps=total 
14. partial (if it is)  
15. reverse complementary (if it is)

	go to IMGT Reptoire>>"1 Locus and Gene">>Gene tables>>IGHV ::HUMAN
	then click on each gene (not allele), then go to see nucletides on the "IMGT/GENE-DB" reference sequences table.
