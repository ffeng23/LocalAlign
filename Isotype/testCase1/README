this is the test case for trouble shooting the error.
the calling commands is
    time ../../ngsmapping_Isotype -d2 -g-10 -e -10 -n 0.8 -l 18  -p 30 -x  -s ./Sample10_182.fasta  -f ../isotype_demux_fullLength.fasta
    
the test example is one sequence from /home/feng/Windows/windowsD/feng/LAB/MSI/MouseLungProject/LBSeq8/Isotype/analysis_LBSeq8_2/
it is Sample10.fasta after filtered umi merged with new merge3 code. originally was on Theon and downloaded to local machine.

this is 182nd sequences. It causes an error.

time ../../ngsmapping_Isotype -d2 -g-10 -e -10 -n 0.8 -l 18  -p 30 -x  -s ./Sample10_182Short.fasta  -f ./isotype_demux_fullLengthIg2ab.fasta
